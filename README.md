This project is recommendation engine which uses user-item collaborative filtering.Machine learing algorithms used are SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) it uses a matrix structure where each row represents a user, and each column represents an item(book). The elements of this matrix are the ratings that are given to items by users.Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)measures similarity for Collaborative filtering recommender system, to evaluate how much two users are correlated.In this way by computing ratings given by user to a book is calculated and books are recommended.

The command prompt will look like this:

(project)C"//.... download>

Go for folder where the files are located

3){e} cd Algorithm-master

Command prompt will look like this:

To run the app,check for .py files 

3){f} dir 

This Will Give The directory of all files in folder

3{g} python recommendation_book.py 

Command Prompt will give activation signal and http://127.0.0.1:8000 address
